# `XRPL Observer`

XRPL Observer is a real-time visualization of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). 
Watch it live on http://observer.xrpldata.com

Credits to @LedgerObserver (Simon HÃ¤rer) on twitter for creating this awesome project. I am very sad that it was discontinued.

It is written in clojurescript using reacl (pure and truly composable clojurescript react library), three.js & ngraph.
